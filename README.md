# Vino Analysis

This is the updated version.

## Intro
Vino is everywhere! Especially white wine is the go the beverage during the summer as it is served best ice cold.
And let's face it: it is extremely hard to determine the quality of a wine, and most people are not able to do it (myself included)!

## About the Data
The dataset contains data from 4898 variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" (white wine). Overall, there are 12 variables in the dataset.
The data is taken from chemical analysis (11 variables) and 1 subjective evaluation by wine experts for the input variable 'quality'.
'quality' represents the median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts. Each expert graded the wine quality between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent).

## Research Question

The variable of interest (dependent variable) is 'quality', since this is the ultimate measure of wine.
In the end, I would like to know which constitutes to look for when buying the next vino.
Therefore, I will investigate what variables might influence the quality.
Finally, I will build a model that can predict wine quality based on its substances.
